->  Make the options variable set of each cell a computed property
    that is computed each time it is accessed. It could compute
    the options by intersecting the row and column sets for example.
    This way we are not continually updating options sets for each type.
    They are created dynamically each time we need to access them.

->  Property observers could be added to properties to run some code each time
    the property changes. For example using the didSet() property observer on
    an options variable could then run code to update other relevant options
    thereby cleaning up the code.
    
->  The box options variable could be removed from the checking process and
    replaced with subRow and subCol options. The subRow and subCol are created
    from the box options anyway, this way the cell options should be the intersection
    of the row and column sets and the subRow and subCol sets. In fact since subRow
    and subCol are a subset of row and column anyway, it should only be these two
    that are required; as long as they are computed correctly to update when their
    parent row or column updates.

->  Insertion Algorithm.
        1. Add value to cell's value property.
        2. Set cell's isEmpty property to false.
        3. Remove value from row options.
        4. Remove value from column options.
        5. Remove value from subRow options.
        6. Remove value from subCol options.
        7. Remove value from box options.
        8. Remove value from options of all sibling cells.
        9. Update adjacent box' subRows.
        10. Update adjacent boc' subCols.
